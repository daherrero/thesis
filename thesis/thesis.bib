	title = {Linear {Queries} {Estimation} with {Local} {Differential} {Privacy}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02810},
	abstract = {We study the problem of estimating a set of \$d\$ linear queries with respect to some unknown distribution \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\$ over a domain \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{J\}=[J]\$ based on a sensitive data set of \$n\$ individuals under the constraint of local differential privacy. This problem subsumes a wide range of estimation tasks, e.g., distribution estimation and \$d\$-dimensional mean estimation. We provide new algorithms for both the offline (non-adaptive) and adaptive versions of this problem. In the offline setting, the set of queries are fixed before the algorithm starts. In the regime where \$n{\textbackslash}lesssim d{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}log(J)\$, our algorithms attain \$L\_2\$ estimation error that is independent of \$d\$, and is tight up to a factor of \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\}(J){\textbackslash}right)\$. For the special case of distribution estimation, we show that projecting the output estimate of an algorithm due to [Acharya et al. 2018] on the probability simplex yields an \$L\_2\$ error that depends only sub-logarithmically on \$J\$ in the regime where \$n{\textbackslash}lesssim J{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}log(J)\$. These results show the possibility of accurate estimation of linear queries in the high-dimensional settings under the \$L\_2\$ error criterion. In the adaptive setting, the queries are generated over \$d\$ rounds; one query at a time. In each round, a query can be chosen adaptively based on all the history of previous queries and answers. We give an algorithm for this problem with optimal \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ estimation error (worst error in the estimated values for the queries w.r.t. the data distribution). Our bound matches a lower bound on the \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ error for the offline version of this problem [Duchi et al. 2013].},
